Description: A bioinformatics software package implementing an S4 object-oriented 
    architecture for targeted gene panel analysis. It ensures strict data integrity 
    between expression matrices and clinical metadata. The package includes 
    algorithms for differential expression (Welch's t-test), statistical 
    visualization (Volcano plots), and prognostic modeling based on median 
    gene expression thresholds.
